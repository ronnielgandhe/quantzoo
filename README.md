# QuantZoo

A lean, credible Python trading strategy backtesting framework with comprehensive validation and no look-ahead bias.

## What it is

QuantZoo is a modular backtesting framework designed for systematic trading strategy development and validation. It features:

- **Modular Strategy System**: Easy-to-implement strategy interface with Pine Script compatibility
- **Realistic Execution**: Configurable fees, slippage, and market impact modeling
- **Walk-Forward Analysis**: Sliding and expanding window validation with purged K-fold cross-validation
- **No Look-Ahead Bias**: Comprehensive testing to prevent future data leakage
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, win rate, profit factor, and more
- **CLI Interface**: Simple command-line tools for running backtests and generating reports
- **Deterministic Results**: Reproducible backtests with seed-based randomization

## Quickstart

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quantzoo/quantzoo.git
cd quantzoo
pip install -e .
```

### Run a Backtest

```bash
qz run -c configs/mnq_808.yaml -s 42
```

### Generate a Report

```bash
qz report -r <run_id>
```

The run ID is displayed after running a backtest and can also be found in `artifacts/metrics.json`.

## Reproduce

To reproduce the MNQ 808 strategy results:

1. **Clone and install** the repository as shown above
2. **Run the backtest** with the provided configuration:
   ```bash
   qz run -c configs/mnq_808.yaml -s 42
   ```
3. **Generate the report** using the returned run ID:
   ```bash
   qz report -r <run_id>
   ```

The backtest will execute on the provided synthetic MNQ 15-minute data and generate:
- Performance metrics in `artifacts/`
- Markdown report with equity curve in `reports/`

## Methodology

### Strategy Implementation

The MNQ 808 strategy is a precise port of the Pine Script v6 code, implementing:

- **Indicator Calculation**: SMA of True Range, ATR, MFI/RSI momentum
- **Signal Generation**: Anchor-based crossover system with session filtering
- **Risk Management**: One-bar adverse exit rule and legacy tick-based stops
- **Position Sizing**: Fixed contract quantity with configurable parameters

### Validation Framework

QuantZoo implements multiple layers of validation:

1. **Look-Ahead Prevention**: Indicators only access historical data
2. **Walk-Forward Analysis**: Time-series aware train/test splits
3. **Purged K-Fold**: Embargo periods prevent label leakage
4. **Realistic Execution**: Fees and slippage applied to all trades
5. **Deterministic Testing**: Seed-based randomization for reproducibility

### Performance Metrics

All metrics are calculated with proper annualization and market assumptions:

- **Sharpe Ratio**: Annualized using âˆš6048 for 15-minute bars (252 trading days Ã— 24 bars/day)
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Peak-to-trough equity decline
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor**: Gross profit divided by gross loss
- **Exposure**: Percentage of time in position

## What is Live vs WIP

### âœ… Live (Working)

- Core backtesting engine with fees and slippage
- MNQ 808 strategy implementation
- Walk-forward analysis with sliding/expanding windows
- Comprehensive test suite with look-ahead validation
- CLI interface for running backtests and generating reports
- Markdown report generation with equity curves
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

### ðŸš§ Work in Progress

- Additional strategy templates and indicators
- Real-time data integration
- Portfolio-level backtesting
- Advanced risk metrics (VaR, Expected Shortfall)
- Web-based dashboard
- Database persistence for large-scale analysis

## Results

Results from the MNQ 808 strategy on synthetic data (seed=42):

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Return | TBD% |
| Sharpe Ratio | TBD |
| Maximum Drawdown | TBD% |
| Win Rate | TBD% |
| Total Trades | TBD |

*Results will be populated after running the acceptance tests*

### Adding a New Strategy

1. Create a new file in `quantzoo/strategies/`
2. Implement the `Strategy` protocol with `on_start()` and `on_bar()` methods
3. Add configuration in `configs/`
4. Update CLI to recognize the new strategy
